# autowriter-backend
Backend Spring project for creating, managing, planning and posting automatically new AI-generated LinkedIn-like texts using ChatGPT's API.
The objective is to reinforce Spring/Jpa/Hibernate courses from my Master's degree as well as manipulating API's (LinkedIn and ChatGPT) to create meaningful and informative social media posts about tech conferences I assist to or watch on YouTube.

Frontend project is not yet created.
